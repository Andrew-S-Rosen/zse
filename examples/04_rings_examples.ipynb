    "This module is the crown jewel of ZSE. I have developed algorithms using graph theory that are able to find rings in zeolite frameworks. There are a number of uses for this information. I use ring finding to in the zse.cation.py module to place cations in each of the rings associated with a T-site. Our group uses the rings associated with an oxygen or a T-site to classify them in a more descriptive way than just saying O1 or T4. Most recently I have been using the rings associated with an oxygen site, tetrahedral site, and entire framework as descriptors for neural networks. I have been able to predict deprotonoation energies, and proton location energies using these methods."
